A chrome extension that turns your new tab into a JavaScript REPL.

To use this yourself, please `fork` this repo and `clone` it to your local machine. From there, follow the installation instructions below:

# Installation

1. `npm install`

2. Open `chrome://extensions`

3. Click `Load unpacked extensions...`

4. Select the directory for this project from your local filesystem

From there, you may wish to modify `script.js` to customize your own experience.
By default, my editor uses the `vim` keybindings, uses `monokai` as the dark theme, and `chrome` as the light theme.

Check out the ACE Editor docs for how to change these sorts of things: https://ace.c9.io/#nav=howto
